Built as a grand gesture of eternal love, the **Temple of Leah** holds stories in every stone, every echo of wind through the statues.

We didn’t talk much, we didn’t need to.

A stranger proposed in the middle of the hall while a live violin played.
It was a little surreal—beautiful, even.

And maybe, one day, life will lead us back here...
not because we planned it, but because the path decided so ✨

For now, distance has its own place too, like silence between notes,
or space between pillars. It doesn’t erase what’s there, it just holds it differently.
