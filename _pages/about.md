🧑‍💻 I'm Hilmi, a passionate Machine Learning Engineer with over 5 years of experience! I specialize in architecting and productionizing advanced ML models that drive business value. My expertise encompasses software development, cloud-based machine learning, and cross-functional collaboration to deliver high-impact & scalable solutions.

💼 I'm currently working as a Data Scientist at PropertyGuru Singapore, where I transform ML projects into revenue-generating solutions. A key highlight of my work includes:

- Led the development of an [Automated Valuation Model](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/knight-frank-malaysia_knightfrank-knightfrankmalaysia-partnersinproperty-activity-7051073263258529792-5Lct): an enterprise-grade B2B product that automates property appraisals for banks and real estate consultants across Malaysia, streamlining their workflows and enhancing decision-making.
- Architected a Regional Dynamic Pricing System: This system significantly enhanced operational efficiency, improved pricing accuracy, and [contributed to the 11% revenue increase YoY](https://investors.propertygurugroup.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx). By automating the pricing process, we increased price update frequency from bi-weekly to daily, optimizing market responsiveness.
