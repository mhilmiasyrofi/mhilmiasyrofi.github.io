🧑‍💻 As a Machine Learning Engineer with over 5 years of experience, I specialize in **architecting & productionizing advanced ML models that drive business value**. My expertise encompasses software development, cloud-based machine learning, and cross-functional collaboration to deliver high-impact & scalable solutions.

💼 I'm currently working as a Data Scientist at PropertyGuru Singapore, where I transform ML projects into revenue-generating solutions. A key highlight of my work includes:

1) **Architected a Regional Dynamic Pricing System**: This system significantly enhanced operational efficiency and improved pricing accuracy to reflect the true value of offerings. By automating the pricing process, we increased price update frequency from bi-weekly to daily, optimizing market responsiveness.
